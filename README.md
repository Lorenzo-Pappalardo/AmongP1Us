# Initial Configuration
First and foremost you should have Python installed, you can get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
Then you need to create a token.txt and simply paste your bot's token, which you can get from Telegram itself as explained [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).<br>
Then you should check config.py which is where you'll find all of the parameters to customize bot's behaviour.<br>
# How to start
Once you've set everything up you can finally start the bot by opening a CLI and executing the command:<br>
`py main.py`
# How to stop
Simply use CTRL+C/Command+C in the the same CLI where you started the bot.
